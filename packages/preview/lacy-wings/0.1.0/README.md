# Lacy Wings
An opinionated utility library.

## Features
- [x] Composing functions.
- [x] Drawing blurred or dashing texts.
- [ ] Short-circuit and pass-through `Maybe` and `Either`.
- [ ] Chinese and CJK-Latin language setup.

## Credits
- The monad-like `Maybe` and `Either` are obviously from Haskell.
- `compose` is inspired by math, and the [weave](<https://typst.app/universe/package/weave/>) package.
- I learned to make the after images from modding with [tModLoader](<https://tmodloader.net/>).
